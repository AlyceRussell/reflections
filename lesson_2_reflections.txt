Q1: What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The initialisation tells the file that it is now a git repositiory and then by
using git commands, we can track changes that occur to the contained files.


Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you can upload documents you wish to add to your
repository. The working directory contains all files. Files are uploaded by
using the code "git add" then "git status" to check they are in the staging
area. Following this, "git commit" is used and a message is added using emacs.


Q3: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

By checking to see that a single file is in your commit. Also, make sure you
save files regularly and leave meaningful notes about each logical commit.
