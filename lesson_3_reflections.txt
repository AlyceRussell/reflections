Q1: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- Collaborating as a larger team with many contributors
- For me, my supervisor in Europe wants to be able to watch how I am coding my studies for my PhD and make suggestions
- It is usesul to have everything online if you work on different computers or travel often
- If you are using a private repository, it is good to have a back-up of everything online
